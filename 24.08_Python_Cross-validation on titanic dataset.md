## 24.08 PYTHON TEAMWORK
```py
## EASY: add DecisionTreeClassifier to titanic data predictions. 
## HARD: Investigate what is cross-validation and implement cross-validation on any classification model you prefer on Titanic data. Explain to each other, what do you see.
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
# Initialize and train the Logistic Regression model
logistic_model = LogisticRegression()
logistic_model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Train the model

# Initialize and train the Decision Tree Classifier
decision_tree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
decision_tree_model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Train the model

# Predict using Logistic Regression
logistic_predictions = logistic_model.predict(X_test)
logistic_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, logistic_predictions)
print(f"Logistic Regression Accuracy: {logistic_accuracy:.2f}")

# Predict using Decision Tree Classifier
decision_tree_predictions = decision_tree_model.predict(X_test)
decision_tree_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, decision_tree_predictions)
print(f"Decision Tree Classifier Accuracy: {decision_tree_accuracy:.2f}")
