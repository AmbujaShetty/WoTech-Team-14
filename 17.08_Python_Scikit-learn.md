### What is an error rate?
The error rate refers to the proportion of incorrect predictions made by a model out of the total number of predictions. In scikit-learn, the error rate can be calculated using the accuracy_score function from the sklearn.metrics module, which gives the accuracy of a model. The error rate can be derived from the accuracy as follows:
```Error Rate=1−Accuracy```


### Where you could use other machine-learning models?
### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised training?
- **Difference in Data:**

Supervised training uses labeled data, where each input is paired with an output.
Unsupervised training uses unlabeled data, and the model must infer patterns from the input data alone.

- **Difference in Objective:**

The objective of supervised learning is to predict labels or outputs for new inputs.
The objective of unsupervised learning is to uncover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data.

- **Difference in Feedback:**

In supervised learning, the model receives direct feedback (correct labels) to guide its learning.
In unsupervised learning, the model does not receive explicit feedback and must infer the structure on its own.

- **Difference in Complexity:**

Supervised learning can be more straightforward because the model is given clear targets to learn.
Unsupervised learning can be more challenging as the model must discover patterns without explicit guidance.
### How to import different models from the scikit-learn package?
These models are used for both classification and regression tasks:
```py
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression #linear
```
```py
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression # logistic
```
```py
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge # Ridge
```
```py
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso # Lasso
```
These are powerful models for classification, regression, and outlier detection:
```py
from sklearn.svm import SVC # SVM for Classification
```
```py
from sklearn.svm import SVR # SVM for Regression
```
```py
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC # Linear SVM
```
