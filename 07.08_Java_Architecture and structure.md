1. What's the importance of each layer
2. Why is there needed some kind of structure and architecture
3. Find other architecture types, figure out pros and cons

Clean Architecture focuses on maintaining a clear separation of concerns between different parts of an application, ensuring that the system is modular, maintainable, and testable. The innermost layers of the software contain the most important business logic, while the outer layers handle infrastructure concerns like UI or database access.

1. Importance of Each Layer in Clean Architecture
   
**Entities (Core Domain):** Hold the core business logic, independent of external systems. They are stable and reusable across different applications.

**Use Cases (Application Layer):** Manage the applicationâ€™s business logic, orchestrating data flow between entities and external systems, ensuring independence from technical concerns.

**Interface Adapters:** Translate data formats and manage communication between the core application and external systems, promoting loose coupling and adaptability.

**Frameworks & Drivers (Infrastructure):** Handle technical details like databases and UI frameworks, keeping the core logic insulated from changes in technology.

2. Why Structured Architecture is Needed
   
**Maintainability:** Allows easy updates with minimal risk.
**Testability:** Facilitates isolated testing of components.
**Scalability:** Supports team collaboration and application growth.
**Adaptability:** Enables easy changes to external systems.
**Reusability:** Core business logic can be reused across projects.

4. Other Architecture Types: Pros and Cons
   
**Layered (N-Tier):**
Pros: Simple, clear separation of concerns.
Cons: Can become rigid and tightly coupled.

**Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters):**
Pros: Decouples core from external systems, enhancing adaptability.
Cons: Complex for smaller projects.

**Microservices:**
Pros: Independent deployment, fault isolation.
Cons: Complex, requires strong DevOps.

**Event-Driven:**
Pros: High scalability, real-time processing.
Cons: Complex debugging, event management challenges.

**Monolithic:**
Pros: Simple to develop and deploy.
Cons: Hard to scale and maintain as it grows.
