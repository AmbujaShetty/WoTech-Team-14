# Task: Visualizing the correlation of Attack and Defense variables of two Types: Grass and Water Type 1 Pokémon.
# Create two DataFrame Grass and Water
# Create the regression plots for each (Grass and Water)
# Calculate the Pearson correlation for each DataFrame (variables: Attack and Defense)
# Explain to each other what do you see and what it means.

#1. Create two DataFrame Grass and Water
Grass = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Grass']
Water = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Water']
#2. Create the regression plots for each (Grass and Water)
sns.regplot(data=Grass, x='Attack', y='Defense', color='green')
sns.regplot(data=Water, x='Attack', y='Defense', color='blue')
#3. Calculate the Pearson correlation for each DataFrame (variables: Attack and Defense
correlation_Grass = Grass['Attack'].corr(Grass['Defense'])
correlation_Water = Water['Attack'].corr(Water['Defense'])
plt.title('Correlation between Attack and Defense for Grass and Water Type 1 Pokémon')
plt.xlabel('Attack')
plt.ylabel("Defense")
print('Pearson correlation coefficient for Grass:', correlation_Grass)
print('Pearson correlation coefficient for Water:', correlation_Water)
